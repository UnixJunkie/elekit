elekit
======

EleKit measures the similarity of electrostatic potentials
between a small molecule and a protein.

EleKit allows to measure the similarity of electrostatic potentials between
a (docked) small molecule and a known ligand protein for the same protein receptor.
EleKit is intended to facilitate the design of
SMPPIIs (Small Molecule Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors).
